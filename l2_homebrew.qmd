title: "Homebrew and Packages for Mac"
---

If you find `zsh`, `bash`, and all those terminal commands to install stuff confusing, 
I was there when I first started out learning data science. With training focused on 
data analysis (more specifically, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, and 
statistical inference), I didn't have much exposure to shell and environment. As long 
as the R packages I used for data analysis worked, I had no complaint. However, as my 
toolbox expanded over time, I found it important to have some basic understanding on
how to manage my tools, which is what homebrew is for. 

### Installing Homebew
Homebrew installs and organizes packages for macOS and Linux. To use homebrew, we install it with: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
# paste the following command in terminal and hit return/enter
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You will be asked for login password:

![](imgs/homebrew/homebrew_1.png){width=72%}

Once you enter your password, you will be shown what are being installed and just follow the prompt:
![](imgs/homebrew/homebrew_2.png){width=80%}

Even if homebrew is already installed, installation will still be run when you hit the `return/enter` key. After installation, you can check where and what version of homebrew is installed:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# check where homebrew is installed
which brew
# check version of homebrew
brew --version
```

By default, Apple silicon chip Mac installs homebrew in `/opt/homebew`, while intel chip Mac installs it in `/usr/local`. As [homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation){target="_blank"} explains, defaulting to those locations avoids `sudo` when install packages. 

### Installing Packages with Homebrew
```{r eval=FALSE}
brew install <PACKAGE_NAME>
# for example, installing PostgreSQL
brew install postgresql
```

The packages will be downloaded to `~/Library/Caches/Homebrew`, installed to their own directory `/urs/local/Cellar` (intel chip Mac), and their files symlinked (symbolic link, a file points to another file or directory in a different location) into `/urs/local/bin` or `/urs/local/opt`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# list packages installed
brew list
# update Homebrew and packages
brew update
# uninstall package
brew uninstall <PACKAGE_NAME>
```

### Uninstalling Homebrew
```{r eval=FALSE}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

### Summary

- install homebrew
- install packages with homebrew
- uninstall packages and/or homebrew
