Welcome to my blog! I was trained as a molecular biologist focusing on biochemistry and molecular biology with a physics minor in college. After college, I worked in a university research lab and then a couple of biotech start-ups as a research associate. Although I earned promotions twice in three years in my second industry job, I also realized that without a PhD in biology, I would hit my career ceiling soon. As I tried to decide what to do, I became curious about efficient decision-making itself. It led me to statistics since statistics provides the tools to find patterns in information and to make informed decisions.

I went back to school for my masters in Biostatistics. During graduate school, I learned to program in R and perform statistical analysis. The applied projects I worked on in school focused on statistical inference (trying to understand whether there is a relationship between variables of interest), but a lot of the time, we cared more about making predictions. Thus, I also enrolled in a data science bootcamp to expand my skill sets in predictive modeling.

After bootcamp, I landed a job as a clinical data scientist at a biotech company, which is developing cancer diagnostic products. My main responsibilities are transforming clinical trial data into analysis-ready data sets and analyzing data to  produce outputs for reports and manuscripts.

Working in a team setting, I get more exposure to tool building, such as developing R packages and Shiny apps for others. I learned to do many things that I would do occasionally, but could be very useful to be able to reproduce quickly since setting things up sometimes requires a lot of time and effort. This blog aims to record some of the things I learned over time and serves as a reference.
