title: "Homebrew and Packages"

If you find `zsh`, `bash`, and all those terminal commands to install this and that
confusing, you are not alone. When I first started out, with training in Data Science
(more specifically, data transformation, exploratory analysis, and statistical
inference), I couldn't care less about shell, environment, and installing tools 
that could work magics, as long as the few R packages I used for data analysis could 
be installed and worked in analysis.
