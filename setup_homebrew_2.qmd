If you find `zsh`, `bash`, and all those terminal commands to install this and that
confusing, you are not alone. When I first started out, with training focused on 
data analysis (more specifically, data transformation, exploratory analysis, and 
statistical inference), I didn't have much exposure to shell, environment, and installing 
tools that are used to build infrastructures. As long as the R packages I used for 
data analysis could be installed and worked in analysis.
